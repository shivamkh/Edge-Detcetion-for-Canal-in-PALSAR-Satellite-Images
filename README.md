# Edge-Detcetion-for-Canal-in-PALSAR-Satellite-Images
Abstract – An edge detection and linking method is developed for the classification of the man-made linear geographic features like canals, roads and the railway connectivities. Presently in the land cover classification methods used it is difficult to extract these type of linear features using the classifier algorithm generally used. By using the edge detection and linking algorithm parallely we can effectively consider these linear features as one separate class and then combine our result with the previous classification result of the Land cover classifier and we can obtain the fully classified Land features. During any natural hazard condition these are the features effected mostly and hence the model can be used to obtain the information about any of the changes. Keywords – edge detection, edge linking, linear geographic features
